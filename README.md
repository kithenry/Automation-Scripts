# Automation Scripts

A collection of Bash and Python scripts for personal productivity, server management, and streamlined workflows across Linux and Windows.

### Overview
This repository houses my personal automation toolkit—scripts designed to simplify note-taking, manage my local server, standardize project setups, and keep my digital life organized. It’s a mix of completed tools and works-in-progress, with a focus on practicality and cross-platform compatibility.

#### Completed Tools
- Telegram Bot
    - Purpose: Control my workflow and server remotely via Telegram.

##### Features:
- Add notes directly to Obsidian from Telegram messages.
- Manage my local server:
    - Check battery status.
    - Retrieve current IP address (a workaround for my dynamic IP setup since I don’t control the router).

#### Works in Progress
- PDF Annotation Parser
    - Goal: Extract annotations from PDFs and format them as structured notes.

- File System Organizer
    - Goal: Maintain a tidy file system with:
        - Empty trash bin enforcement.
        - Naming convention checks for files in each folder.
        - A central file location with symlinks in other folders.

- Obsidian Sync Workflow Scripts
    - Goal: Automate syncing of Obsidian notes with a Git repository, supporting both Windows and Linux.

- Notes Decomposer
    - Goal: Parse a single blob of text into individual, formatted notes—reducing the overhead of manual organization.

- Git Setup Scripts
    - Goal: Streamline new repository creation with:
    - Repo naming.
    - Access token generation and .gitignore updates.

- System Setup Scripts
    - Goal: Automate configuration for development tools like NVIM and VSCode.

- Project Setup Script
    - Goal: Standardize project initialization with:
    - Git repository setup and required branches.

- Git Manager
    - Goal: Manage all repositories with:
    - Standardized README formats.
  - Automated TODO item updates (add or mark as done).
  - Repository renaming capabilities.

- Central Password Manager
    - Goal: Provide secure password generation and access for personal use.

#### Usage
- Requirements: Bash, Python 3.x, and (for some scripts) Telegram API access.
- Setup: Clone the repo and check individual script comments for dependencies and instructions.
- Cross-Platform: Most scripts are designed to work on both Linux and Windows (with minor tweaks where noted).

#### Contributing
This is a personal project, but feel free to fork it or suggest ideas! I’m always looking to refine these tools.
